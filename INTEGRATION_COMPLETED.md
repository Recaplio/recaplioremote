## 🎯 Next Steps: Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: To activate the intelligent features, you need to run the database migration:

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `conversation-persistence-migration.sql` from your project root
4. Copy and paste the entire SQL content
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Option 2: Supabase CLI
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Verification
After running the migration, verify the tables were created:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_conversation_sessions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_conversation_messages;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_conversation_context;
```
